# NeuralNet
This is my final project for a neural networks class. I implement a conjugate gradient backpropagation learning algorithm from scratch and compare it to a run of the mill conjugate gradient backpropagation algorithm.
I compare and contrast the two algorithms and examine their training and generalization performance while varying mini batch size on the MNIST data set.

Look at the report.pdf to see my performance comparison. 

This is posted for public use, and to help others learn from my experience, however plagarism is wrong, don't do it.
